# Mission-to-Mars
_in progress_

## Objective
This project intended to create a webpage meant to show a true passion for Mars. Herein, I used a html-python import to open a local browser, naviate to and around a webpage, and store the links and images to a database from python. 

## Translating Objective into Deliverables
Deliverable: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles

## Complications and Workarounds 
While navigating the webpage from python, I found that explicit variables (variables defined within the very cell) worked best. Without this factor the code completed here would be unable to run.

## Tools Used
- BeautifulSoup
- Splinter
- Pandas
